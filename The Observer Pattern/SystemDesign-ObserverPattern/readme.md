# Observer Pattern Example (Java)

This repository provides a very basic and clear implementation of the **Observer design pattern** in Java. It's designed for quick understanding of the core concepts, demonstrating how objects can notify their dependents about state changes.

## ðŸŒŸ What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the **Subject**) changes state, all its dependents (the **Observers**) are notified and updated automatically.

It's akin to a **newsletter subscription service**:
* The **Newsletter Publisher** is the **Subject**.
* The **Subscribers** are the **Observers**.

When a new edition (state change) is published, all subscribers are automatically informed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Components Illustrated

This example highlights the three fundamental roles:

1.  **`Observer` (Interface):**
    * Defines the `update()` method that all concrete observers must implement. This is the contract for receiving notifications.
    * *In our code:* `Observer.java`

2.  **`Subject` (Concrete Class):**
    * Maintains a list of its `Observer`s.
    * Provides methods (`addObserver`, `removeObserver`) for observers to subscribe/unsubscribe.
    * Has a method (`setState`) to change its internal state, which then triggers the notification of all registered observers.
    * *In our code:* `Subject.java`

3.  **`ConcreteObserver` (Concrete Class):**
    * Implements the `Observer` interface.
    * Contains the logic to perform actions when it receives an `update()` notification from the `Subject`.
    * *In our code:* `ConcreteObserver.java`

## ðŸš€ How to Run This Example

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Compile the Java files:**
    ```bash
    javac Observer.java Subject.java ConcreteObserver.java Demo.java
    ```
3.  **Run the demonstration:**
    ```bash
    java Demo
    ```

## ðŸ§  Why Use the Observer Pattern?

* **Loose Coupling:** Subject and Observers are independent. They don't need to know each other's specific implementations, only that they adhere to a common interface (`Observer`). This makes the system more flexible.
* **Modularity:** You can add new observers or change existing ones without modifying the subject.
* **Reusability:** Observers can be reused with different subjects, as long as the subjects adhere to the notification mechanism.
* **Event Handling:** It's a cornerstone for event-driven architectures (e.g., GUI programming, real-time data updates).
