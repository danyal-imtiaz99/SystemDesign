## üèóÔ∏è Building Distributed Systems from the Ground Up

Welcome to my System Design Laboratory - a collection of hands-on Java projects focused on implementing and understanding distributed systems concepts. This repository documents my journey to master system design principles through practical implementation.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning tool and a portfolio to:

- Implement distributed systems concepts in real-world applications
- Document design decisions and architectural patterns
- Provide working examples of scalable, resilient systems
- Track my growth in system design expertise

## üß© Projects

Each project tackles different system design challenges:

| Project | Focus Areas | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| [Distributed Cache](./distributed-cache/) | Consistency, Partitioning, Replication | In Progress |
| [Task Scheduler](./task-scheduler/) | Fault Tolerance, Load Balancing | Planned |
| [Data Pipeline](./data-pipeline/) | Stream Processing, Event Sourcing | Planned |
| [Service Mesh](./service-mesh/) | Service Discovery, Circuit Breaking | Planned |
| [Distributed Database](./distributed-database/) | Sharding, Consensus Algorithms | Planned |
