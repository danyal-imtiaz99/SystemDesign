# System Design Laboratory

## 🏗️ Building Distributed Systems from the Ground Up

Welcome to my System Design Laboratory - a collection of hands-on Java projects focused on implementing and understanding distributed systems concepts. This repository documents my journey to master system design principles through practical implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning tool and a portfolio to:

- Implement distributed systems concepts in real-world applications
- Document design decisions and architectural patterns
- Provide working examples of scalable, resilient systems
- Track my growth in system design expertise


## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Languages**: Java, Kotlin
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Quarkus, Micronaut
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra
- **Messaging**: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Testing**: JUnit, Gatling, Chaos Monkey
